  **attempting to do:** (would also work for windows but for mac chrome keyboard shortcut key commands as example):
  1) ctrl-t opens a new browser tab in google chrome.
  2) lets say user is on tab[1] (cmnd-1 mac ctrl-1 pc) and user ctrl-t to create a new tab[i], that tab is pushed to the end of the array.
  3) Whose to say whether these tabs are an array or a linked list or friends, but the javascript method of doing what this output achieves is array.push()
  4) This browser extension would take a ctrl-t from googleBrowserTabIndex[1] and create that new googleBrowserTabIndex[i] in a linked-list-like [i+1] .NEXT fashion.

  ** WHY: **
  usually only have 4 tabs or so but have 8 as am in the middle of a current deployment, and the new tab flies at the end. It's not the end of the world but it's not as fast. 
  (of course it's not as slow as stopping this deployment to build the extension but it's an idea worthy of atleast some consideration and sounds like interesting functionality to implement)

  Just at 4:12am was going to call this file and browser extension (aftertab) but 1 second away from clicking [commit changes] thought it's more clever to call it bartab since it uses the toolbar.
  I would guess this functionality to exist in the wild already, but if it doesn't and someone reads this and beats me to it please think of own name for it! or use aftertab. Lucked out with bartab name
